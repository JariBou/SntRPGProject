To make levels idea:
have a  main file in which you import the level classes with a constructor with the player as input
so that it keeps the same player.

main file
-> level1(Player player)    // maybe have levelx return a true or false to kno when to stop or not a loop (assert)
-> level2(Player player)    // or invoque an end screen when dead that offers to restart and lauches the main again
->....
